### Autonomy increases productivity 

One of the cornerstones to excellent success in the workplace is autonomy. We know that when individuals have some control over what they do, how they do it, when they do it, and who they do it with, they like their employment more, engage more deeply, and perform at a far better level.

Every work entails some degree of autonomy and self-direction. Every profession and every individual are entitled to the rewards of having control over their own life.

If team members had the option to customize their occupations in ways that were personally significant to them, they would be more involved in their work, enjoy it more, and stay longer, resulting in a higher retention rate.


### Work challenge vs fexibility (control) 

When team members have a good mix of work challenge and control (flexibility), they will experience flow, a delightful state in which they will do things at the ideal pace while avoiding fatigue.


### Autonomy audit 

We may ask our team members the four following questions to assess a company's autonomy matrix on a scale of one to 10: 

- How much control do we have over your job tasks? That is, our primary tasks and what we perform on a daily basis.  

- How much control do we have over your time at work now? That is, when we arrive, when we depart, and how we divide our time each day. 

- How much control do we have over our work team? That is, how much control do we have over the individuals we work with and cooperate with? 

- How much control do we have over our work technique? How do you truly carry out the primary obligations of our job?

This autonomy audit will open our eyes, spark a discussion, and help us to create a workplace where individuals can achieve their absolute best. When people enjoy times of complete autonomy, they do excellent work as autonomy is the route to creativity and invention. However, there must be a time constraint, such as 1 or 2 hours per week of autonomy in which members may pick which activities they will work on.
