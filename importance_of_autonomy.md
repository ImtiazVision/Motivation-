### Autonomy increases productivity 

One of the cornerstones to excellent success in the workplace is autonomy. We know that when individuals have some control over what they do, how they do it, when they do it, and who they do it with, they like their employment more, engage more deeply, and perform at a far better level.

Every work entails some degree of autonomy and self-direction. Every profession and every individual are entitled to the rewards of having control over their own life.

If team members had the option to customize their occupations in ways that were personally significant to them, they would be more involved in their work, enjoy it more, and stay longer, resulting in a higher retention rate.


### Work challenge vs fexibility (control) 

When team members have a good mix of work challenge and control (flexibility), they will experience flow, a delightful state in which they will do things at the ideal pace while avoiding fatigue.
