# Motivation-

**Controlling contingent reward**, often known as if then rewards, is a fundamental principle about workplace motivation that we must all understand.


If then rewards are good for basic, short-term goals but not so good for complicated, long-term projects.

### Purpose, mastery, and autonomy 

Purpose, mastery, and autonomy are three fundamental motivators for long-term achievement. 

Purpose is do people know why they're doing something, not merely how to do it? Are they making a difference? Are they making a contribution? 

Mastery, are people getting better at something that matters? Are they making progress in meaningful work? 

Autonomy, do people have a say? Do they have some control over what they're doing, how they're doing it, who they're doing it with, where they're doing it, and when they're doing it?
