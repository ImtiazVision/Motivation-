# Motivation-

Making progress in important work is the single most powerful day-to-day motivation on the workplace.

**Controlling contingent reward**, often known as if then rewards, is a fundamental principle about workplace motivation that we must all understand.


If then rewards are good for basic, short-term goals but not so good for complicated, long-term projects.

### Purpose, mastery, and autonomy 

Purpose, mastery, and autonomy are three fundamental motivators for long-term achievement. 

**Purpose** is do people know why they're doing something, not merely how to do it? Are they making a difference? Are they making a contribution? 

**Mastery**, are people getting better at something that matters? Are they making progress in meaningful work? 

**Autonomy**, do people have a say? Do they have some control over what they're doing, how they're doing it, who they're doing it with, where they're doing it, and when they're doing it?

Purpose, mastery, and autonomy are powerful motivators because they are compatible with human nature, are more difficult to exhaust than if-then rewards, and lead to enduring performance
